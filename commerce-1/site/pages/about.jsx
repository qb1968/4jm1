          Melissa is originally from New Jersey but moved to Maryland by way of
          her military husband. Melissa loves the challenge of creating custom
          designs for her clients…her knack for organization and her ability to
          thrive under pressure helps her navigate her busy schedule. Melissa
          has worked in dentistry for 13 years, so creating custom pieces such
          as badge reels is one of her favorite things to do. Melissa is excited
          to bring her skill set to her customers, and surrounding community.
          Melissa adores her veteran husband and three children…she can’t get
          enough of them! When Melissa isn’t in the dental office or working for
          her business, this easy-going crafter tends to her 22’ x 22’ fruit and
          veggie garden. You can also find Melissa savoring a cup of coffee and
          admiring her flower beds on the weekends.
